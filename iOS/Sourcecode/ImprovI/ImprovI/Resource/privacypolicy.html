<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at improvi, how improvi uses it, and what choices you have.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When we talk about “improvi,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to improvi Technologies, Inc., the company which provides the Services. When we talk about the “Services” in this policy, we are referring to our online workplace productivity tools and platform. Our Services are currently available for use via a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or mobile device, as further described in our <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/articles/201746897-Slack-apps-for-computers-phones-tablets"><span class="s2">Help Center</span></a>.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 18.0px Helvetica; color: #555459; -webkit-text-stroke: #555459"><span class="s1"><b>1. Customer Data</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Content and information submitted by users to the Services is referred to in this policy as <b>“Customer Data.”</b> As further explained below, Customer Data is controlled by the organization or other third party that created the team (the <b>“Customer”</b>). Where improvi collects or processes Customer Data, it does so on behalf of the Customer. Here are some examples of Customer Data (but keep in mind they are only examples and there may be others): messages (including those in channels and direct messages), pictures, videos, edits to messages or deleted messages, and other types of files. A user may also choose to enter information into their profile, such as first and last name, job, a photo and a phone number.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you join a team and create a user account, you are a “user,” as further described in the <a href="https://slack.com/terms-of-service/user"><span class="s2">User Terms of Service</span></a>. If you are using the Services by invitation of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual, that Customer determines its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Customer Data which may apply to your use of the Services. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings it has in place.</span></p>

  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Billing and other information.</b> For Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services, our corporate affiliates and our third party payment processors may collect and store billing address and credit card information on our behalf or we may do this ourselves.</span></li>

  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Log data.</b> When you use the Services our servers automatically record information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you are using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before using the Services, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your use of the Services, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Device information.</b> We may collect information about the device you are using the Services on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Geo-location information.</b> Precise GPS location from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. WiFi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Services integrations.</b> If, when using the Services, you integrate with a third party service, we will connect that service to ours. The third party provider of the integration may share certain information about your account with improvi. However, we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third party services. For more information on service integrations, <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/articles/202035138-Add-an-app-to-your-team"><span class="s2">click here</span></a>.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Third party data.</b> improvi may also receive information from affiliates in our corporate group, our partners, or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This might be aggregate level information, such as which IP addresses go with which zip codes, or it might be more specific information, such as about how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.</span></li>
